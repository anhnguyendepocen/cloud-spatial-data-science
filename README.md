# cloud-spatial-data-science

This repository houses an in-progress book I am writing 2018 on how to set up a spatial data science environment in the cloud, using the example of Ubuntu Linux running on Amazon EC2.  

Doing spatial data science on EC2 is likely appealing to many professionals, but the start-up learning curve is significant, especially for people coming from other operating system backgrounds.  These tutorials will cover: 

* How to set up an Ubuntu Linux environment on EC2 if you've never used Linux before; 
* How to install core geospatial libraries on Ubuntu; 
* How to install R and RStudio Server on EC2; 
* Using RStudio as an interface to your operating system; 
* Setting up and using a JupyterLab server on EC2 with core spatial data science libraries (e.g. geopandas & pysal)

I'll be writing this book "in the open" so content will certainly be subject to change.  I also welcome your contributions through pull requests to this repository!
